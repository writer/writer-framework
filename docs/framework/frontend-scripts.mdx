Framework can interact with frontend to import custom JavaScript/ES6 modules, set data into local storage, trigger module functions, ...

## Importing an ES6 module

Similarly to [stylesheets](/stylesheets), front-end scripts are imported via Framework's `mail` capability. This allows you to trigger an import for all or specific sessions at any time during runtime. When the `import_frontend_module` method is called, this triggers a dynamic [import()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) call in the front-end.

The `import_frontend_module` method takes the `module_key` and `specifier` arguments. The `module_key` is an identifier used to store the reference to the module, which will be used later to call the module's functions. The `specifier` is the path to the module, such as `/static/mymodule.js`. It needs to be available to the front-end, so storing in the `/static/` folder is recommended.

The following code imports a module during event handling.

```py
def handle_click(state):
    state.import_frontend_module("my_script", "/static/mymodule.js")
```

If you want the module to be imported during initialisation, use the initial state.

```py
initial_state = wf.init_state({
    "counter": 1
})

initial_state.import_frontend_module("my_script", "/static/mymodule.js")
```

<Note> 
Use versions to avoid caching. Similarly to stylesheets, your browser may cache modules, preventing updates from being reflected. Append a querystring to invalidate the cache, e.g. use `/static/script.js?3`. 
</Note>

## Writing a module

The module should be a standard ES6 module and export at least one function, enabling it to be triggered from the back-end. As per JavaScript development best practices, modules should have no side effects. An example of a module is shown below.

```js
let i = 0;

export function sendAlert(personName) {
    i++;
    alert(`${personName}, you've been alerted. This is alert ${i}.`);
}
```

## Calling a function

Once the module is imported, functions can be called from the back-end using the `call_frontend_function` method of state. This function takes three arguments. The first, `module_key` is the identifier used to import the module. The second, `function_name` is the name of the exported front-end function. The third, `args` is a `List` containing the arguments for the call. 

The following event handler triggers the front-end function defined in the section above.

```py
def handle_click(state):
    state.call_frontend_function("mymodule", "sendAlert", ["Bob"])
```

## Import a JS script

Framework can also import and run JavaScript scripts directly, for their side effects. These are imported via the report's `import_script` method. This method takes two arguments. The first, `script_key` is the identifier used to import the script. The second, `path` is the path to the file. The specified path must be available to the front-end, so storing it in your application's `./static` folder is recommended.

```py
initial_state = wf.init_state({
    "counter": 1
})

initial_state.import_script("my_script", "/static/script.js")
```

<Warning> 
Prefer ES6 modules: importing scripts is useful to import libraries that don't support ES6 modules. When possible, use ES6 modules. The `import_script` syntax is only used for side effects; you'll only be able to call functions from the back-end using modules that have been previously imported via `import_frontend_module`.  
</Warning>

## Importing a script from a URL

Framework can also import scripts and stylesheets from URLs. This is useful for importing libraries from CDNs. The `import_script` and `import_stylesheet` methods take a `url` argument, which is the URL to the script or stylesheet.

```python
initial_state = wf.init_state({
    "my_app": {
        "title": "My App"
    },
})

initial_state.import_script("lodash", "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.21/lodash.js")
```

## Local storage

Framework provides functions to interact with browser's local storage. This mechanism allows information such as user preferences to be persisted between several sessions.

*  `state.local_storage_set_item(key, value)`: set a value in local storage.
*  `state.local_storage_remove_item(key)`: remove a key from local storage.

```python
# Event handler register on root:wf-app-open
def on_app_open(state, session):
    state['last_visit'] = session['local_storage'].get('last_visit', "")
    state['dark_mode'] = session['local_storage'].get('dark_mode', "False") == "True"
    state.local_storage_set_item("last_visit", str(datetime.now()))


def on_dark_mode_toggle(state, payload):
    state['dark_mode'] = payload
    state.local_storage_set_item("dark_mode", str(state['dark_mode']))


initial_state = wf.init_state({
    "last_visit": "",
    "dark_mode": False
})
```

<Warning>
	Framework propose a binding on [Local storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). It support only raw value. Your application has to serialize the data before storing it. Framework won't do it for you.
</Warning>

<Warning>
	Local storage is not secure and should not be used to store sensitive data without encryption. It's accessible to anyone with access to the user's device.
</Warning>

<Info>
	Content of local storage is loaded in `session` on the init request. If a JS function change a value inside, it won't be reflected. Change from the backend are reflected.
</Info>

## Frontend core

<Warning> 
Effectively using Framework's core can be challenging and will likely entail reading its [source code](https://github.com/writer/writer-framework/blob/master/src/ui/src/core/index.ts). Furthermore, it's considered an internal capability rather than a public API, so it may unexpectedly change between releases.
</Warning>
You can access Framework's front-end core via `globalThis.core`, unlocking all sorts of functionality. Notably, you can use `getUserState()` to get values from state.

```js
export function alertHueRotationValue() {
    const state = globalThis.core.userState.value.
    console.log("State is", state);
}
```
