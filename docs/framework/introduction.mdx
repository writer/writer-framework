The Writer Framework lets you build feature-rich apps by using a drag-and-drop visual editor called **the Builder** and writing the back-end code in Python. It's fast and flexible, with clean, easy-to-test syntax. It provides separation of concerns between UI and business logic, enabling more complex apps.

Build AI apps with the Writer Framework when:

1. You need to incorporate external data sources, such as external APIs
2. You have complex user input that requires custom logic, such as conditions that trigger the use of different prompts
3. You want to quickly analyze and visualize data using an LLM

The Writer Framework offers:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Easily-testable Python functions" >
    Define event handlers as plain Python functions.
    ```python
    def handle_text_update(state):
        state["text"] = "Updated text"

    writer.init_state({
        "text": "Initial text"
    })
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Visual editor">
    Link the event handler and state to the UI seamlessly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Standard Python packages">
    Install with a simple pip command.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version control">
    Save user interfaces as JSON to be version controlled with the rest of the app.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Flexible editing">
    Use your local code editor with instant refreshes or the provided web-based editor. Edit the UI while your app is running without needing to click “Preview.”
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimal overhead">
    Event handling adds only 1-2ms to your Python code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Real-time synchronization">
    Use WebSockets to synchronize front-end and back-end states.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Efficient execution">
    Non-blocking by default, with asynchronous event handling in a dedicated thread pool.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customizable elements">
    No CSS required for customization like shadows, button icons, and background colors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="HTML integration">
    Include HTML elements with custom CSS using the HTML Element component, which can serve as containers for built-in components.
  </Accordion>
