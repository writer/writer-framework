## Contributing to the repository

If you wish to contribute to the repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. Failure to discuss the changes beforehand will likely cause your pull request to be rejected, regrettably.

Make sure to run the tests, which can be found in `/tests`, and pass mypy validation. Code formatting is important; Prettier is used in the frontend while autopep8 is used in the backend.

Pull requests should be done on the `dev` branch. When the release is finalised, `dev` will be merged into `master`.

## Setting up a development environment
